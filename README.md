# On the Sample Complexity of GNNs

This repository contains the code used in the paper **"On the Sample Complexity of GNNs."**

## Contents

- **`DL_Sample_GNN_autosave (1).py`**  
  This is the main script that includes the full pipeline for training and testing the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models presented in the paper.

- **`Plot_Results_of_Paper.ipynb`**  
  A Jupyter notebook for plotting the results generated by the main script.  
  > **Note:** This notebook includes precomputed values obtained from running the main script on our local machine.  
  > To generate updated plots, first run the main script, then update the notebook with the new output values.

## Usage

1. Run `DL_Sample_GNN_autosave (1).py` to train and evaluate the GNN models.
2. Open `Plot_Results_of_Paper.ipynb` to visualize the results. Modify the notebook as needed to include the latest output from the main script.
